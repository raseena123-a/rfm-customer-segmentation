###  Tools Used:
- SQL (for data storage and manipulation)
- Python (for RFM score calculation)
- Power BI (for interactive dashboard visualization)
 ### Key Visuals:

## Conclusion
This project successfully applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Using a combination of SQL for data storage, Python for metric calculation, and Power BI for visualization, we identified key customer segments such as:
Champions
Big Spenders
Recent Customers
At Risk
Frequent Buyers
Others
These segments provide actionable insights into customer behavior, allowing businesses to implement targeted marketing strategies. By focusing efforts on high-value segments and re-engaging at-risk customers, companies can potentially increase customer engagement by at least 10%.
The interactive Power BI dashboard enables dynamic exploration of customer data, helping decision-makers track spending patterns, engagement levels, and customer loyalty in real-time.
Overall, this end-to-end RFM analysis empowers organizations to become more data-driven, customer-centric, and strategically aligned in their marketing initiatives.
